## Workflow

`main` is the primary branch.

We'll be working in feature branches.

Create a new branch called: `feature/masthead`.

Those feature branches can only be merged via a pull-request once approval has been met. All feature branches will spawn off our Github Issues.

You can keep track of our progress in the Project screen.

## The way we did this contact form

- We create an html document(share.html with its css file named share.css)
- We use a section as a container to store the code
- The form has /contact-form action and all the user inputs are inserted inside of a few fieldset elements and we use border transparent in order to hide them.
