## Workflow

`main` is the primary branch.

We'll be working in feature branches.

Create a new branch called: `feature/PATTERN_NAME`.

Those feature branches can only be merged via a pull-request once approval has been met. All feature branches will spawn off our Github Issues.

You can keep track of our progress in the Project screen.
